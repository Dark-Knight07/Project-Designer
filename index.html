            <h2>Every idea<img src="assets/img/idea.png" alt="idea" class="idea-img"> <br> starts with a<br> need</h2>
            <p> In 2018. I started to think about how I could improve my design skills 
                 . I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time  I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with
                what I thought. I saw that many designers made a daily user interface, I really
                liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                problem.
